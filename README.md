# Yonsei NLP Study Season 3
![main](./img/summary.PNG) <br>
**[About Yonsei NLP Study]** <br>
Yonsei NLP Study is consisted of 4 Students who are very passionate in the field of Natural Language Processing! <br>
Every week, each student read papers regarding a certain subject. <br>
Then, each student gets to present about the topic he prepared for. <br>
After the presentation, all the students discuss about that paper and share ideas. <br>
<br>
**[About Season 3]** <br>
